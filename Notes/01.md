# Chapter 1

This chapter starts out by introducing Boolean logic and Boolean functions. The chapter goes over using truth tables and Boolean functions to describe logic.

One topic that is addressed is using truth tables to create large Boolean functions and then using different properties to simplify these properties.

This course is based around the concept that as you create one logic gate (or chip, as they often call it), you can use it in the future without worrying about how you made the first gate. 

This course of course focuses on how NAND gates can be used to create every other logic gate.

The idea here is that you can use AND NOT and OR gates to build every other logic gate, and that these in turn can be made using only NAND gates.
